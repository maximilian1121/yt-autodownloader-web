# Youtube/Spotify download thing web app

I don't know the name yet... It is supposed to be a web app to auto download all videos and spotify links as wav files to the /home/user/Music folder (no windows support unless it is wanted) as my DJ laptop is running Ubuntu and I need a way to quick download all my music.
